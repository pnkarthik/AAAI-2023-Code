1. Run total-cost-varying-C-bernoulli.py to generate a csv file named total-cost-varying-C-bernoulli.csv.

2. Run FedElim-and-periodic-comm-cost-comparison-bernoulli.py to generate a csv file named FedElim-and-periodic-comm-cost-comparison-bernoulli.csv.

3. Run FedElim-periodic-comm-total-cost-comparison-bernoulli.py to generate a csv file named FedElim-periodic-comm-total-cost-comparison-bernoulli.csv.

4. Feed the above csv files as inputs to plotting-script-bernoulli.py to generate Figures 4a-4c of the paper.
